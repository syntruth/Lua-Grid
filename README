Version 1.0  - 7/19/2006

This library exports it's classes into a global 'grid'
table.

Usage:

require "grid"
G = grid.Grid(8, 8, "-")
G:set_cell(4, 4, "X")

neighbors = G:get_neighbors(4, 4)
for _, obj in neighbors do
  local s = string.format("Object is %s", tostring(obj))
  print(s)
end

Exposed Methods

  is_valid(x, y)             Checks to see if a given cell is within the grid.
  get_cell(x, y)             Gets the cell's data.
  get_cells(cells)           Gets a set of data for x,y pairs in table 'cells'.
  set_cell(x, y, obj)        Sets the cell's data to the given object.
  reset_cell(x, y)           Resets the cell to the default data.
  reset_all()                Resets the entire grid to the default data.
  populate(data)             Given a data-filled table, will set multiple cells.
  get_contents(no_default)   Returns a flat table of data suitable for populate()
  get_vector(vector)         Translates a GRID_* vector into a x,y vector pair.
  get_neighbor(x, y, vector) Gets a x,y's neighbor in vector direction.
  get_neighbors(x, y)        Returns a table of the given's cell's 8 neighbors.
  resize(newx, newy)         Resizes the grid. Can lose data if new grid is smaller.
  get_row(x)                 Gets the row for the given x value.
  get_column(y)              Gets the column for the given y value
  traverse(x, y, vector)     Returns all cells start at x,y in vector direction.

Caveats:

  The Grid object is data agnostic.  It doesn't care what 
  kind of data you store in a cell. This is meant to be, 
  for abstraction's sake. You could even store functions.

  Never put a nil value in a cell, even as a default value,
  since that can break loops that parse through cell data.
  Remember, the first nil value returned to a 'while' or 
  'for' loop breaks the loop, which might not be what you 
  are looking for. If you can't think of what to put in 
  'empty' cells, use GRID_NIL_VALUE.

  The class defines -no- display methods. Either sub-class
  the Grid class to add your own, or define functions that
  call the get_cell() method.

  Grid coordinates are always x,y number pairs. X is the 
  vertical, starting at the top left, and Y is the 
  horizontal, also starting at the top left. Hence, the 
  top-left cell is always 1,1. One cell to the right is
  1,2. One cell down is 2,1.

  Some Grid constants (OUTSIDE, NOT_VALID, NIL_VALUE) are 
  not numbers, but strings, just in case number data is to 
  be stored in a cell.
